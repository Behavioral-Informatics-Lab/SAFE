# Toward Fairness Across Skin Tones in Dermatological Image Processing

Abstract:
Skin cancer is a prevalent and concerning form of can-cer, with an annual incidence rate estimated to be more than3 million cases in the US. In recent years, the field of medi-cal image processing has made a remarkable progress in thedomain of skin cancer detection, surpassing the diagnos-tic capabilities of dermatologists in certain settings. How-ever, it has been reported that the performance of these deeplearning detection models varies significantly across differ-ent skin tones (e.g., light versus dark), motivating the needfor fair and unbiased classification results. Here, we evalu-ate DeepDerm [10], a state-of-the-art skin cancer detectionmodel, specifically focusing on its performance across skintypes classified by the Fitzpatrick Skin Tones (FST). By an-alyzing the modelâ€™s accuracy and fairness, we observe no-table discrepancies in its performance across different FSTcategories. We propose a novel architecture that leveragesfine-tuning, an ensemble architecture, and fairness-basedresampling for supporting high accuracy and fairness inskin cancer detection. The proposed framework demon-strates promising outcomes, marking a significant stridetoward achieving fairness and accuracy in dermatologicalimage processing.
